### What's a post-conversation survey bot?

A post-conversation survey bot lets you collect feedback from consumers at the end of a conversation with a custom bot or human agent. The survey bot can ask:

* Specialized questions designed to provide First Call Resolution (FCR), Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), and Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey metrics
* Questions that reflect your brand's key performance indicators
* Free-text questions

Use a post-conversation survey bot to measure bot/agent and skill performance and to identify opportunities to improve on your quality targets.

For a more in-depth introduction to surveys and survey metrics, see [here](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-post-conversation-surveys-post-conversation-survey-bot.html) in the Knowledge Center.

{: .important}
To use survey bots created in Conversation Builder, you must be on the LivePerson platform, i.e., you log into Conversation Builder via single sign-on through Conversational Cloud. This feature isn't supported on the AWS platform where you log into Conversation Builder directly.<br><br>Survey bots are supported only in Messaging, not in Live Chat.<br><br>Only English-language survey bots are supported.

### The survey flow

#### Survey triggering
When a conversation is ended (either by the consumer or the agent), if the conversation's last skill matches one assigned to the survey bot, the survey bot automatically begins the survey.

The above also means that:

* There is no need to "transfer" to the survey. This happens automatically.
* A conversation that doesn't have an assigned skill can't trigger a survey.

If a conversation is closed automatically because it's been idle for a time, a survey **isn't** triggered.

#### Survey timeout

By default, a survey times out (expires) after one hour, but you can change this time period if desired. You can also configure a "Session Expired" message to send to the consumer if they try to enter text after the session has expired. Both of these settings are found in Bot Settings, discussed farther below.

#### Survey outcomes

A survey can be closed in the following ways:

* The survey is completed.
* The survey times out.

Both outcomes are tracked and reported on as part of the Analytics Builder, so you can fully analyze the results.

### Prerequisite steps

Before you can begin building survey bots, the feature must be enabled in Conversation Builder by LivePerson. Please contact your LivePerson account representative to enable this feature.

### Creating the survey bot

1. Log into Conversation Builder.
2. From the Bots dashboard, click **New Bot** in the upper-right corner.
3. In the Choose a Bot Template dialog, select **Survey Bot**.
4. In the Survey Bot dialog, specify the following:
    * **Name**: Enter a name for the bot that's concise and clear.
    * **Description**: Enter a description that's meaningful to you and others.
    * **Bot Language**: Select a language.
    * **Skill**: Select the skill(s) that will trigger this survey bot. A skill can be assigned to only one survey bot. You can add skills in Conversational Cloud.
5. Click **Create Bot**.

    This creates a survey bot that includes a single dialog of type "Survey" (that's also named "survey" by default). Define the survey in this dialog.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_newSurvey.png">

    For easy visibility, in the dashboard that lists your bots, the skill(s) assigned to a survey bot are listed beneath the bot name.

    <img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_dashboard.png">

### Building out the survey bot

#### Adding survey interactions

In the dialog that's of type "Survey," define the survey. There are three types of survey interactions:

* First Call Resolution (FCR)
* Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)
* Net Promoter Score (NPS)

The survey interactions are predefined in the sense that you can't edit their structure, i.e., add or remove answer choices. However, you can change the question and answer text.

{: .important}
In a single survey bot, you can include only one of each survey interaction type.

##### FCR interaction

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_fcr.png">

##### CSAT interaction

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_csat.png">

##### NPS interaction

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_nps.png">

{: .important}
If you change the answer choices for a survey question, remember to update the defined conditions accordingly in the interaction's details.

{: .important}
When the target channel is Apple Business Chat, the survey interactions (NPS, CSAT, FCR) are automatically sent to the consumer as List Picker interactions.

#### Marking survey questions as optional

To add a Skip option and thereby make a survey question optional, click the **+Skip** response and turn it from Off (blue) to On (white).

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:350px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_skip.png">

Clicking **Skip** automatically adds a custom rule for the "skip" response, so you can build out the survey logic as you require.

{: .important}
In an NPS interaction, don't enable Skip if your targeted channel is Facebook. Facebook doesn't support structured content that has more than 11 quick replies. The NPS question plus the Skip option is 12 quick replies. Using Skip will cause the conversation to end abruptly.

#### Configuring the display format

In the **Advanced Settings** of each of the survey interactions, you can configure two display settings:

* Display Choices As
* Text Only Fallback > List Style for Choices

Use the **Display Choices As** setting to specify whether and how to send the answer choices to the consumer. You can select:

* **Quick Reply**: Select this to send the answer choices as quick replies in channels that support them. In text-based channels, the format specified in **List Style for Choices** will be used.
* **Button**: Select this to send the answer choices as buttons in channels that support them. In text-based channels, the format specified in **List Style for Choices** will be used.
* **Do not display**: Select this to hide the answer choices in *all* channels. Only the survey question will be sent to the consumer. If you select this, the **List Style for Choices** setting plays no role.

<img style="width:500px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_displayChoices.png">

When you deploy your survey bot to a channel that doesn't support rich content formatting (i.e., SMS or WhatsApp), the survey questions are automatically sent as plain text. Use the **List Style for Choices** setting to control how the choices are presented in a text-only fallback scenario. You can select:

* **1. 2. 3. 4.** or **a. b. c. d.**: Select either of these to send the answer choices using the indicated format.
* **no list**: Select this to hide the answer choices. Only the survey question will be sent to the consumer.


#### Handling free text answers

The handling of free text answers works in a survey bot just like it does in a custom bot. For example, when presented with the the CSAT yes/no question, if the consumer types "yes" or "Yes" instead of selecting "Yes," the response is understood. If the consumer enters anything else, the fallback response is sent. You can use conditions to catch other patterns if desired.

#### Handling unrecognizable responses

In the survey interactions in a survey bot, the fallback response is required, and there's a default value provided.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:800px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_fallback.png">

You can customize the default fallback responses in the survey interactions.

You cannot create a [Fallback dialog](conversation-builder-dialogs-fallback-dialogs.html).

#### Adding standard interactions

You can use only a subset of the standard interaction types in the Survey dialog; unavailable interactions are hidden from view on the toolbar.

Use the standard interactions to ask questions that reflect your brand's custom key performance indicators (KPIs) and/or other free-text questions. For example, you might want to obtain the consumer's age.

#### Closing the survey conversation

Close a survey conversation with [Close Dialog](conversation-builder-dialogs-dialog-basics.html#close-the-dialog).

You don't need to include a Text interaction that thanks the consumer for their participation; you can define the Thank You message in the survey bot's settings (discussed below).

{: .important}
Make sure that a custom bot *that triggers a survey bot* also uses Close Dialog. [Close Dialog](conversation-builder-dialogs-dialog-basics.html#close-the-dialog) allows a post-conversation survey to be triggered, but [Close Conversation](conversation-builder-dialogs-dialog-basics.html#close-the-conversation) does not.

### Configuring the survey bot's settings

1. Open the survey bot, and click <img style="width:25px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/icon_ellipsisVertical.png"> (3-dot icon) in the upper-left corner, just to the right of the menu bar.
2. Select **Bot Settings**.
3. Configure the survey bot settings as needed; these are described below.
4. Configured other bot settings as needed; these are described [here](conversation-builder-bots-bot-basics.html#configure-bot-settings).
5. Click **Save**.

Survey bot settings include:

- **Skill**: If desired, change the skill(s) that will trigger this survey bot.
- **Thank You Message**: Enable this to send a Thank You message before the survey conversation is closed. Then enter the message to send.
- **Session Expired Message**: Enable this to send a Session Expired message when the user enters text after the session has timed out. Then enter the message to send. (For information on the **Session Length** setting, a related setting that's displayed for all bots, see [here](conversation-builder-bots-bot-basics.html#configure-bot-settings).)

### Deploying the survey bot

You don't manually deploy a survey bot. When LivePerson enables this feature for your brand, this deploys the underlying agent connector that's shared by all survey bots. Therefore, **as soon as you create a survey bot and assign it a skill, the bot is active and can receive conversations.** Typically, brands don't develop in their Production environments, but if you do, for this reason, it's recommended that you assign to the survey bot a "test" skill that isn't used in a production campaign and use that to validate the bot before assigning it a production skill.

### Triggering the survey bot

In order to trigger the survey, start a conversation on the account and skill on which you’ve defined the survey and bring the conversation to an end, either from the consumer or the agent side. Once the conversation closes, the survey will be triggered, and the agent workspace will show the caption, “Survey in progress.”

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:700px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_triggerSurvey.png">

While the survey is active the agent won’t be able to write in the conversation. The survey will end when the consumer finishes entering the survey (if you've specified "Close Conversation" as the next action) or when the survey times out. In cases of an error with the survey flow or the survey bot, Conversational Cloud will close the survey after 48 hours as part of a conversation cleanup process.

### The agent experience

Once a conversation ends and a survey begins, the conversation no longer appears in the **Open Conversations** list in Conversational Cloud. Instead, it appears in the **All Conversations** list with a status that indicates the survey is in progress:

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:850px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_agent1.png">

If an agent has permissions to view survey results, the agent can see the survey transcript.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:400px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_agent2.png">

### The manager experience

In the **Conversations panel** of the **Manager Workspace**, managers can view the survey scores (CSAT and NPS only) for all conversations shown.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:1000px" src="img/ConvoBuilder/surveyBot_manager1.png">

### Reporting

#### Analytics Builder
Metrics from the FCR, CSAT, and NPS questions in surveys are captured in Conversational Cloud and exposed via the [Analytics Builder](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/data-reporting-report-builder-report-builder-overview.html) application. You'll find this information in the predefined [Survey Dashboard for Messaging](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/data-reporting-messaging-messaging-dashboards-survey-dashboard-for-messaging.html), which you can use out-of-the-box or manipulate to create customized reports.

#### Bot Analytics
In the [Bot Analytics](bot-analytics-overview.html) application, you'll see survey bots reported in the same way as custom bots. There is no difference between the two.

### Monitoring survey bots

If you have Bot Status Access [permissions](bot-accounts-permissions.html), you can use the Bots Status application that's intended for monitoring agent connectors to [monitor your survey bots](bots-status-managing-post-conversation-survey-bots.html). In Bots Status, you can redeploy the connector as a troubleshooting technique.

### FAQs

#### I currently use Bot Studio to create survey bots. How do I migrate to using Conversation Builder?

See [this topic](https://knowledge.liveperson.com/ai-bots-automation-post-conversation-surveys-migrating-from-bot-studio-to-conversation-builder.html) in the Knowledge Center for information on how to make the switch.

#### How do I disable a survey bot?

If you need to temporarily remove a survey bot from your customer traffic flow (i.e., prevent it from triggering), access the bot's **Skill** setting in **Bot Settings**, and remove the assigned skill(s).

#### Are survey bots supported in text-only channels?

Yes, this works just like for a custom bot. The survey questions are displayed as plain text.

#### Can a consumer skip a survey entirely?

There's no way for the consumer to indicate they want to skip the survey entirely (e.g., no Skip button). However, the consumer can close the window to leave the survey.
